            <h4>“First Bicycle Lanes in Davis.” Davis California, https://www.cityofdavis.org/about-davis/history-symbols/first-bicycle-lanes-in-davis. Accessed 9 May 2023. </h4>
            <p>
                This article explains the City of Davis’ first bicycle lane that was developed on a city street. It also describes how before the development of bike lanes in Davis, residents were concerned about safety issues regarding the bikers on roads. The article more specifically, describes the 3rd Street implementation and Sycamore Lane Experiment, which happened in 1967. This article provides an in-depth explanation of one of the main parts of the panel that I would like to explore for this project; the panel I chose represents the first bike lanes that have ever been implemented. Reading about this article inspired me to explore different ways I can represent that particular part of the seal.

            <h4>Podoll, Heather. Davis, CA, 2000, pp. 2–3, Davis Farmer’s Market Case Study: Connecting Farms and Community. </h4>
            <p>
                This case study explains in depth the Davis Farmers Market, DFM, beginning from its history until its overall opportunities of DFM. The part that informs me the most about this project is the history part of DFM. It explains how it began and how it became “one of the first four certified farmers' markets in the state.” The information provided from this case study allows me to appropriately address what is so special about the farmers’ market, specifically in Davis, and why it is proudly taking a part of the panel that I chose. I learned that DFM is one of the biggest successes that the Davis community has created as a whole, which eventually helped local farmers sell their produce.

            <h4>Shelton, Susan. “Seals.” Davis Centennial Seal Information, susanshelton.com/Seals/Davis-Centennial-Seal/Description-of-Innovative-Contributions-Panel. Accessed 8 May 2023.</h4> 
            <p>
                This website is created by Susan Shelton, the artist who created the Davis Centennial Seal, which displays the artworks that she has done. This specific part of her website has information about the Davis Centennial Seal and also has more detailed descriptions of individual panels. The panel that this part of her website talks about is “Innovative Contributions of Citizens”, related to my topic of interest for this project. The information that Susan Shelton provides explains different parts of the panel with the use of bullet points. The information that she has is not opinionated, and it relies on the research results that she had conducted as she created the Davis Centennial Seal.
