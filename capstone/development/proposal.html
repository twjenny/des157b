    <h1>Capstone Proposal</h1>
    <section id="first">
            <h4>TOPIC & TARGET AUDIENCE</h4>
            <p>I want to focus on the specific panel, which is about Vision, Innovation, and Engagement of citizens. The panel includes images of farmer's market, bike lanes, and bikes. I would like to create a mobile application that allows users to explore Davis and physically surround themselves with the environment that they see in the seal. My target audience would be Davis visitors, who are either visiting for their first time or here for a special occasion.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>PARTNER</h4>
            <p>I would like to work with a partner, but I have not specifically thought about who to work with.
            I believe some of the features that I would include would be camera, drag and drop, and a visitor board for those who want to leave message that they were here.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>CONCERNS</h4> 
            <p>I have a general idea of how the app would look, but I am wondering how to make users motivated to even use this application and how to make this application more engaging.
