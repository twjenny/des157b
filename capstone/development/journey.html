        User journey was a great way to explore how our product would be introduced to the users, and how our product would be used in a real life setting. Some of the things that our user journey partner found confusing was how our product will be discovered; my partner and I was thinking of a flyer, whether it is an electronical or physical form but it seemed like it was not clear in the user journey. Our user journey partner also suggested different rules we might be able to implement for our game!
