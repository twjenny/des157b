        As I am working with a partner, creating a paper prototype helped us narrow down our possible explorations and be on the same page in terms of design and mechanics of the product. One of the biggest issues from the user test was that it was unclear in what button the user was supposed to click. For example, there was a section where the user had to press on to an answer to the question and then press a check button to submit the answer. However, the user only clicked on to the answer of the question and was waiting for the next screen to show. Besides that, the user tester told us that the theme was interesting and she also liked how the section to select the topics was in a shape of the capstone.
